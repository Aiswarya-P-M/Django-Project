from django.db import models
from app_School.models import School  # Import School from the app_School app
from app_Department.models import Departments  # Import Department from the app_Department app

# Create your models here.
class Teacher2(models.Model):
    name=models.CharField(max_length=50)
    emp_id=models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    performance=models.FloatField(default=0)
    created_on=models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_on=models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    sc_id = models.ForeignKey('app_School.School', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING,null=True,blank=True)
    dept_id=models.ForeignKey('app_Department.Departments', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, null=True, blank=True)
```
The `Teacher2` model represents teachers and includes fields for personal details, performance metrics, and associations with school and department.

### Field Descriptions

- **name**: Stores the teacher's name as a character field, with a maximum length of 50.
- **emp_id**: An auto-incremented primary key field that uniquely identifies each teacher.
- **performance**: A float field representing the teacher's performance score, with a default value of 0.
- **created_on**: Automatically captures the timestamp when a teacher record is created.
- **updated_on**: Automatically updates the timestamp whenever a teacher record is modified.
- **sc_id**: A foreign key linking to a `School` model from `app_School`, indicating the school associated with the teacher.
- **dept_id**: A foreign key linking to a `Departments` model from `app_Department`, representing the department associated with the teacher. 

This model allows for capturing essential information about each teacher, their affiliation, and performance metrics.

### => Overview of Scripts.py file


This script performs two main tasks: updating student-teacher associations and recalculating teacher performance metrics.

```python
from App2.models import Student1
from app_Teacher.models import Teacher2 
from App2.utils import calculate_teacher_pass_percentage



def datafetch():

    # Fetch all teacher employee IDs
    teacher_ids = Teacher2.objects.values_list('emp_id', flat=True)
    print("Teacher IDs:", list(teacher_ids))

    # Fetch all students
    students = Student1.objects.all()

    # Iterate through all students
    for student in students:
        try:
            # Get the teacher based on the student's teacher ID
            if student.teacher_id in teacher_ids:  # Ensure the teacher exists
                teacher = Teacher2.objects.get(emp_id=student.teacher_id)
                student.teacher_id = teacher  # Assign the teacher to the student
                student.save()  # Save the changes

                # Print confirmation for each student update
                print(f"Updated student ID {student.name} ({student.name}) with teacher ID {teacher.emp_id} ({teacher.name})")
            else:
                print(f"No matching teacher ID {student.teacher_id} for student ID {student.name} ({student.name}).")
        except Teacher2.DoesNotExist:
            print(f"Teacher with ID {student.teacher_id} does not exist for student ID {student.name} ({student.name}).")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while updating student ID {student.name}: {e}")

def update_teacher_performance():
    teachers=Teacher2.objects.all()
    for teacher in teachers:
        try:
            pass_percentage=calculate_teacher_pass_percentage(teacher.emp_id)
            teacher.performance=pass_percentage
            teacher.save()
            print(f"Updated performance for Teacher ID {teacher.emp_id} ({teacher.name}) to {teacher.performance}%")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while updating performance for Teacher ID {teacher.emp_id}: {e}")

def run():
    print("Fetching the data")
    datafetch()
    print("Updating teacher performance...")
    update_teacher_performance()
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
 
```

1. **Function: `datafetch()`**
   - **Purpose**: Associates each student with their corresponding teacher.
   - **Process**:
     - Retrieves teacher IDs from the `Teacher2` model.
     - Iterates through all students, checking if their `teacher_id` exists among the fetched IDs.
     - Updates students with the appropriate teacher object and saves the changes, printing confirmation or error messages.

2. **Function: `update_teacher_performance()`**
   - **Purpose**: Updates the performance percentage for each teacher.
   - **Process**:
     - Iterates through all teachers and calculates their pass percentage using the utility function `calculate_teacher_pass_percentage()`.
     - Updates the teacher's performance attribute and saves it, printing confirmation or error messages.

3. **Function: `run()`**
   - **Purpose**: Executes the main tasks of the script.
   - **Process**:
     - Calls `datafetch()` to update student-teacher links.
     - Calls `update_teacher_performance()` to refresh teachers' performance metrics.

4. **Execution Block**:
   - The script runs the `run()` function when executed as the main module.

## =>URL Pattern
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import *

urlpatterns=[
    path('',SchoolcreateView.as_view(),name='create_school'),
    path('byid/<int:sc_id>',SchooldetailsView.as_view(),name='school_details')
]
```
## **Department App**

### => Models.py file
```python
from django.db import models
# from app_School import models as school_model
# from App2 import models as Teacher_model
# Create your models here.
# from App2.models import Teacher

class Departments(models.Model):
    hod_name=models.ForeignKey('app_Teacher.Teacher2',on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING,null=True,blank=True)
    dept_name=models.CharField(max_length=100)
    dept_id=models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    sc_id = models.ForeignKey('app_School.School', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING,null=True,blank=True)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_on=models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
```
The `models.py` file defines a `Departments` model with the following fields:

- **`hod_name`**: A foreign key linking to the `Teacher2` model, representing the head of the department. It can be null or blank.
- **`dept_name`**: A character field for the name of the department, limited to 100 characters.
- **`dept_id`**: An auto-incrementing primary key for the department.
- **`sc_id`**: A foreign key linking to the `School` model, representing the school to which the department belongs. It can also be null or blank.
- **`created_on`**: A timestamp indicating when the department record was created, automatically set.
- **`updated_on`**: A timestamp indicating when the department record was last updated, automatically set.

This model facilitates the organization of departments within schools and associates them with their respective heads and schools.

### => Admin Registration
```python
admin.site.register(Department)
```
### => Serializers
```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Departments
from app_School.models import School

class DeptSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    sc_id = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(queryset=School.objects.all())
    class Meta:
        model = Departments
        fields = '__all__'
```
The `serializers.py` file defines a `DeptSerializer` class, which is a serializer for the `Departments` model. Here's a brief explanation:

- **`DeptSerializer`**: This class inherits from `serializers.ModelSerializer`, allowing it to automatically handle the serialization and deserialization of `Departments` instances.
- **`sc_id`**: This field is a `PrimaryKeyRelatedField`, which establishes a relationship with the `School` model. It ensures that only valid school IDs from the `School` queryset can be assigned.
- **`Meta` class**: Specifies the model to be serialized (`Departments`) and includes all fields from the model (`fields = '__all__'`).

Overall, this serializer facilitates the conversion of `Departments` model instances to and from JSON format, ensuring that relationships with the `School` model are properly handled.

### => API Endpoints
