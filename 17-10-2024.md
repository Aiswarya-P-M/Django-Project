## **1. Django Rest Framework**

Django Rest Framework (DRF) is an open-source framework built on top of Django, designed to simplify the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides tools for building APIs quickly and efficiently, supporting complex data types, custom authentication, permissions, serialization, and more. Its powerful features like the browsable API, viewsets, routers, and built-in support for authentication make DRF a go-to solution for API development.

Key Features:

1. Serialization: Converts Django models and querysets to JSON or XML and vice versa.

2. Browsable API: A user-friendly interface for API interaction directly in a browser.

3. Authentication & Permissions: Supports multiple authentication methods (Session, Token, OAuth) and customizable permissions.

4. Pagination, Filtering, and Search: Supports pagination and easy-to-use filters to retrieve data.

5. Viewsets & Routers: Simplify the process of defining API endpoints and routing them with minimal code.

6. Throttling & Rate Limiting: Helps protect APIs from excessive use by throttling requests.

## **Installation of Django Rest Framework**

Follow these steps to install Django Rest Framework:

Prerequisites:

* Python: Ensure you have Python installed (usually version 3.x).

* Django: DRF works on top of Django, so you need to have Django installed in your environment.

```python
pip install djangorestframework
```
After installation, you need to include rest_framework in your INSTALLED_APPS list in the Django settings file.
```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Django default apps...
    'rest_framework',
]
```

## **2. Serializers**
Serializers in Django Rest Framework (DRF) are responsible for converting complex data types (such as Django models) into native Python data types that can then be rendered into JSON, XML, or other formats for APIs. Similarly, serializers can also handle incoming data and convert it back into complex data types (like model instances) for creating or updating objects in the database.

Serializers are essential in any API to manage how data is transferred between the client and the server, ensuring it's in a format both can understand.

```python 
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import *

class Studentserializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Student
        fields = "__all__"
```
*``serializers.ModelSerializer:``* 

* This class simplifies creating serializers by automatically generating fields based on the model.

* It maps the fields in the Student model to serializer fields.

*`Meta Class:`*

* model = Student: Indicates that this serializer is tied to the Student model.

* fields = "__all__": Tells the serializer to include all fields from the Student model (e.g., first_name, last_name, age, etc.) in both the serialization (model to JSON) and deserialization (JSON to model) processes.

* This serializer handles converting Student objects to JSON for API responses and validating/processing incoming JSON data to create or update Student records.

* It saves time by automatically using all model fields, avoiding the need to define them manually.

## **3. CRUD Operaions 
CRUD operations represent the four basic functions of persistent storage. These operations are commonly used in web applications and APIs to interact with data. Here’s an explanation of each operation—GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE:

## 1. GET

*Purpose:*

* Retrieve data from the server.

*How it works:*

* When a client (like a web browser or mobile app) sends a GET request to a specific API endpoint, it requests data from the server.

* The server processes the request and returns the requested resource (e.g., a list of items, a specific item, etc.) in the response, usually in JSON format.


```python
class StudentView(APIView):
    def get(self,request):
        students=Student.objects.all()
        serializer=Studentserializers(students, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
```
* It queries the Student model to get all student records.
  
* The data is serialized using Studentserializers with many=True, indicating that multiple records are being serialized.

* Finally, the serialized data is returned in the response as JSON.

## 2. POST

*Purpose:* 

* Create a new resource on the server.

*How it works:*

* A client sends a POST request to the server, usually including data in the body of the request that represents the new resource.

* The server processes the request, creates the resource in the database, and typically returns a response that includes the created resource's details (often including its ID).

```python
def post(self,request):
        serialize=Studentserializers(data=request.data)
        if serialize.is_valid():
            serialize.save()
            return Response(serialize.data,status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
        else:
            return Response(serialize.errors,status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
* It initializes a Studentserializers instance with data from the request.

* The serializer checks if the data is valid.

* If valid, it saves the new student record and returns the serialized data with a 201 Created status.

* If invalid, it returns the errors with a 400 Bad Request status.

## 3. PUT
   
*Purpose:* 

Update an existing resource on the server.

*How it works:*

* A client sends a PUT request to the server with the updated data in the body of the request.

* This request is usually directed at a specific resource identified by its unique ID.

* The server processes the request, updates the resource in the database, and returns a response indicating the success of the operation, often including the updated resource.
```python
def put(self,request,id):
        students=Student.objects.get(id=id)
        serialize=Studentserializers(students,data=request.data)
        if serialize.is_valid():
            serialize.save()
            return Response(serialize.data,status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
        else:
            return Response(serialize.errors,status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
*Purpose:* 

* The put method is used to update an existing student record.

*Flow:*

1. Retrieve Student: It fetches the student record using Student.objects.get(id=id).

2. Initialize Serializer: The method creates a Studentserializers instance, passing in the existing student data and the new data from request.data.

3. Validate Data: It checks if the incoming data is valid using serialize.is_valid().

4. Save Updated Record: If the data is valid, serialize.save() is called to update the student record in the database.

5. Response:

* Success: If the update is successful, the updated data is returned in the response with a 200 OK status.

* Validation Errors: If the data is invalid, it returns the errors with a 400 Bad Request status, indicating the issues with the provided data.


## 4. DELETE

*Purpose:* 

* Remove a resource from the server.

*How it works:*

* A client sends a DELETE request to the server, targeting a specific resource by its unique ID.

* The server processes the request, deletes the resource from the database, and usually returns a response indicating the success of the operation (often with a status code like 204 No Content).
```python
def delete(self,request,id):
        try:
            students = Student.objects.get(id=id)
            name=students.Name
            students.delete() 
            return Response({'message': f'Student {name} deleted successfully'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
        except Student.DoesNotExist:
        # Handle the case where the student doesn't exist
            return Response({'error': 'Student not found'}, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
        except Exception as e:
        # Log and handle other exceptions
            print(e)
            return Response({'error': 'An error occurred'}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
*Explanation*

*Purpose*:

1. The delete method is designed to remove a specific student record identified by its ID.

*Flow:*

1. Retrieve Student: It tries to find the student using Student.objects.get(id=id). If successful, it stores the student's name in the name variable.

2. Delete Record: The method calls students.delete() to remove the student from the database.

3. Success Response: If the deletion is successful, a JSON response is returned with a success message and a status code of 200 OK.

4. Exception Handling:

* Student.DoesNotExist: If no student is found with the given ID, it returns a 404 Not Found response with an error message.

* General Exceptions: Any other exceptions are logged (optional) and a 400 Bad Request response is returned.
