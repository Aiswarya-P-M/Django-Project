## is_active 

The is_active field in Django is typically a Boolean field (models.BooleanField) used to indicate whether a particular record is active or inactive. Itâ€™s commonly found in models to allow "soft deletions" (deactivating instead of deleting records) and is often used in authentication to mark a user as active or inactive.

```python
is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True) 
```
Update all the models with the field is_active.
