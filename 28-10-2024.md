## 1. is_active 

The is_active field in Django is typically a Boolean field (models.BooleanField) used to indicate whether a particular record is active or inactive. It’s commonly found in models to allow "soft deletions" (deactivating instead of deleting records) and is often used in authentication to mark a user as active or inactive.

```python
is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True) 
```
Update all the models with the field is_active.

```python
class Departments(models.Model):
    hod_name=models.ForeignKey('app_Teacher.Teacher2',on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING,null=True,blank=True)
    dept_name=models.CharField(max_length=100)
    dept_id=models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    sc_id = models.ForeignKey('app_School.School', on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING,null=True,blank=True)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_on=models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    is_active=models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

## 2. ActiveManager
In Django, an Active Manager is a specialized Manager that allows you to define custom querysets and methods for a model. Managers in Django are responsible for database operations, and by default, every model has at least one manager called objects. However, you can create custom managers to define complex queries or filter specific subsets of data.

```python
class ActiveManager(models.Manager):
    def  get_queryset(self):
        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_active=True)
```
* **Purpose**: Filters the default queryset to include only records where is_active=True.

* **Usage**: Add active = ActiveManager() to your model, then use ModelName.active.all() to get only active items.
  
In the models.py file we write 

```python
objects = models.Manager()  # The default manager
active_objects = ActiveManager()
```
Now we need to perform some tasks:

Inactivate a `school`, `department`, `teacher`, or `student`.

<!-- 2. When inactivating a school, all corresponding departments, teachers, and students within that school must also be inactivated.

1. When inactivating a department, all corresponding teachers and students within that department must also be inactivated.

2. When inactivating a student, the teacher's performance record must be updated.

3. When inactivating the teacher no other fields will change.   -->


## 1. Inactivating school

While inactivating a school the corresponding Department,student and teacher will be inactive.
```python
class SchooldeactivateView(APIView):
    #deactivating the schood by id
    def put(self, request, sc_id):
        try:
            # Deactivate the school
            school = School.objects.filter(sc_id=sc_id).update(is_active=False)
            if school == 0:
                return Response({"error": "School not found"}, status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)

            # Deactivate related departments
            departments = Departments.objects.filter(school_departments_list__sc_id=sc_id)
            departments.update(is_active=False)

            # Deactivate teachers associated with these departments
            teachers = Teacher2.objects.filter(department__in=departments)
            teachers.update(is_active=False)

            # Deactivate students associated with these departments
            students = Student1.objects.filter(dept_id__in=departments)
            students.update(is_active=False)

            return Response({"message": "School and associated records set to inactive successfully"}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

        except Exception as e:
            return Response({"error": str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
The `SchooldeactivateView` is a Django REST Framework API view that handles deactivating a school and its related records through a `PUT` request. Here’s a concise overview:

1. **Deactivate School**: It attempts to deactivate the school identified by `sc_id`, setting `is_active` to `False`. If no school is found, it returns a 204 No Content response.

2. **Deactivate Related Records**:
   - **Departments**: All departments linked to the school are also marked as inactive.
   - **Teachers**: Teachers associated with these departments have their `is_active` status set to `False`.
   - **Students**: Students linked to the deactivated departments are marked inactive.

3. **Response**: If successful, it returns a 200 OK response with a success message. If any errors occur, it catches the exception and returns a 400 Bad Request with the error details.

*Output*
```json
{
    "message": "School and associated records set to inactive successfully"
}
```

## 2. Inactivating Department

When inactivating a department, all corresponding teachers and students within that department must also be inactivated.

```python
class DeptdeactivateView(APIView):
    # function for inactivate department
    def put(self, request, dept_id):
        try:
            # Set department to inactive
            dept = Departments.objects.filter(dept_id=dept_id).update(is_active=False)
            
            if dept == 0:
                return Response({"error": "Department not found"}, status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
            
            # Update related Teacher2 records by clearing the department relationship and setting is_active to False
            teachers = Teacher2.objects.filter(department__dept_id=dept_id)
            teachers.update(is_active=False)
            for teacher in teachers:
                teacher.department.clear()  # Clear many-to-many relationship
            
            # Update related Student1 records by setting dept_id to None and is_active to False
            students = Student1.objects.filter(dept_id=dept_id)
            students.update(dept_id=None, is_active=False)
            
            return Response({"message": "Department details set to inactive successfully"}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
        
        except Exception as e:
            return Response({"error": str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
This code defines a Django API view to deactivate a department and update related records.

1. **Deactivate Department**: 
   Finds the department by `dept_id` and sets `is_active` to `False`. If not found, returns a "Department not found" response.

2. **Update Related Teachers**:
   Finds teachers in that department, sets `is_active` to `False`, and clears their department association.

3. **Update Related Students**:
   Finds students in that department, sets `dept_id` to `None` (removing department), and marks them as inactive.

4. **Response**:
   Returns success if all updates complete, otherwise catches and returns any errors.

*Output*
```json
{
    "message": "Department details set to inactive successfully"
}
```
## 3. Inactivating Student
When inactivating a student, the teacher's performance record must be updated.
```python
class StudentdeactivateView(APIView):
    def put(self, request, rollno):
        try:
            # Update the student record directly using the update method
            updated_count = Student1.objects.filter(rollno=rollno).update(is_active=False)

            if updated_count == 0:
                return Response({'error': 'Student not found'}, status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)

            return Response({'message': 'Student record set to inactive successfully'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

        except Exception as e:
            return Response({"error": str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
The `StudentdeactivateView` class is an API view for deactivating a student record based on their `rollno`. 

### Key Points:
- **PUT Method**: Handles PUT requests to update the `is_active` field of a student to `False`.
- **Update Logic**: Uses `update` to set `is_active=False` for the student with the specified `rollno`.
- **Response Handling**:
  - Returns `204 No Content` if no student is found.
  - Returns `200 OK` with a success message if the student is successfully deactivated.
  - Catches exceptions and returns a `400 Bad Request` with the error message if any issues occur. 

Overall, it provides a straightforward way to deactivate a student record while handling potential errors.

*Output*
```json
{
    "message": "Student record set to inactive successfully"
}
```
## 4. Inactivating Teacher
While deactivating a teacher it will not effect any other field.
```python
class TeacherdeactivateView(APIView):
    def put(self, request, emp_id):
        try:
            # Update only the is_active field
            updated_count = Teacher2.objects.filter(emp_id=emp_id).update(is_active=False)

            if updated_count == 0:
                return Response({"error": "Teacher not found"}, status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)

            return Response({'message': "Teacher data set to inactive successfully"}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)

        except Exception as e:
            return Response({"error": str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
```
The `TeacherdeactivateView` class is an API view that handles the deactivation of a teacher's record using their `emp_id`. Here’s a concise explanation:

### Key Points:

1. **PUT Method**: 
   - The `put` method takes `emp_id` to identify the teacher to deactivate.

2. **Update Logic**:
   - It attempts to set the `is_active` field to `False` for the teacher with the specified `emp_id`.

3. **Response Handling**:
   - If no teacher is found (i.e., `updated_count` is zero), it returns a `204 No Content` error message.
   - If the update is successful, it responds with a success message and a `200 OK` status.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The method uses a try-except block to catch exceptions, returning a `400 Bad Request` response if an error occurs.
