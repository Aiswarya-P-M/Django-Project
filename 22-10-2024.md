Created a new model Teacher with fields name, emp_id and performance.
```python
class Teacher(models.Model):
    name=models.CharField(max_length=50)
    emp_id=models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    performance=models.FloatField(default=0)
```
Then this emp_id in the Teacher model connected with the teacher_id in the Student table using the foreign key relation
```python
teacher_id = models.ForeignKey(Teacher, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING,null=True,blank=True)
``` 
We used shell.py file for making the connection. For this we opened shell in terminal using the command 
```python
python manage.py shell
```
Then we entered codes like

```python
from App2.models import *
teacher_names=Student1.objects.values_list('classteacher',flat=True).distinct()
emp_id=100
teacher=Teacher.objects.all()
for value in teacher_names:
    Teacher.objects.create(name=value,emp_id=emp_id)
    emp_id +=1
```
This code is designed to populate the `Teacher` model with unique teacher names derived from the `classteacher` field in the `Student1` model. By extracting distinct teacher names and assigning them sequential employee IDs starting from 100, it ensures that each teacher has a unique entry in the database. This approach automates the creation of `Teacher` records based on existing data in `Student1`.

Instead of using the shell.py we can create a scripts.py file and add a file named as demo.py inside this file. we need to get the performance of each teachers according to the performance pf students. For finfing the performance we created a function inside the utils.py file.

```python
def calculate_teacher_pass_percentage(teacher_id):
    # Count the total number of students for the given teacher
    total_students = Student1.objects.filter(teacher_id=teacher_id).count()
    
    # Count passed students for the teacher (total_marks > 150)
    passed_students_count = Student1.objects.filter(teacher_id=teacher_id, total_marks__gt=150).count()

    if total_students > 0:
        # Calculate pass percentage
        pass_percentage = (passed_students_count / total_students) * 100
        return round(pass_percentage,2)
    
    return 0
```
We can find the performance using the function inide the scripts.py file.
```python
def update_teacher_performance():
    teachers=Teacher2.objects.all()
    for teacher in teachers:
        try:
            pass_percentage=calculate_teacher_pass_percentage(teacher.emp_id)
            teacher.performance=pass_percentage
            teacher.save()
            print(f"Updated performance for Teacher ID {teacher.emp_id} ({teacher.name}) to {teacher.performance}%")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred while updating performance for Teacher ID {teacher.emp_id}: {e}")
```
We can run this code using 
```python
python manage.py runscript demo
```
we need to write the demo function inside the run() method.
