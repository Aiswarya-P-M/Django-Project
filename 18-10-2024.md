## **Student Table**

The Student Table API is developed with Django and Django REST Framework, providing endpoints to manage student data, calculate performance metrics, and filter information based on specified criteria. This API is designed to streamline student record handling, offering a structured approach to creating, reading, updating, and deleting records while efficiently calculating and retrieving performance data as needed.

## **Model**

In Django, a model is a Python class that defines the structure of a database table. Each model maps to a single database table, and the class attributes represent the columns (fields) of that table. Django models allow developers to define the data they want to store and provide an interface to interact with the database.
Here’s an explanation of the fields in your Student model:

Model Fields in Student

1. name

```python 
name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```
* Field Type: CharField is used to store short text or strings.

* Purpose: Stores the student’s name.

* max_length=50: Limits the maximum length of the name to 50 characters.

2. rollno
```python
rollno = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
```
* Field Type: AutoField is an automatically incrementing integer field.

* Purpose: Stores a unique ID for each student (roll number).

* primary_key=True: Makes rollno the primary key, meaning it uniquely identifies each record in the table.
  
3. Maths
```python
maths = models.FloatField()
```
* Field Type: FloatField is used to store decimal numbers.

* Purpose: Stores the marks obtained by the student in the Maths subject.

4. Chemistry
```python
chemistry = models.FloatField()
```
* Field Type: FloatField

* Purpose: Stores the marks obtained by the student in Chemistry.

5. chemitry
```python
physics = models.FloatField()
```
* Field Type: FloatField

* Purpose: Stores the marks obtained by the student in Physics.
  
6. total_marks
```python
total_marks = models.FloatField(editable=False)
```
* Field Type: FloatField

* Purpose: Stores the total marks calculated by summing the maths, chemistry, and physics fields.

* editable=False: Prevents this field from being directly edited in forms, as it is calculated in the model's save method.

7. percentage
```python
percentage = models.FloatField(editable=False)
```
* Field Type: FloatField

* Purpose: Stores the percentage calculated from the total_marks.

* editable=False: Prevents direct editing, as the value is calculated automatically.

*Custom save Method*

The save method in the model is overridden to calculate total_marks and percentage whenever a new student record is saved:
```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs): 
    self.total_marks = self.maths + self.chemistry + self.physics
    self.percentage = (self.total_marks / 300) * 100
    super(Student, self).save(*args, **kwargs)
```
This method ensures:

* total_marks is the sum of maths, chemistry, and physics marks.

* percentage is calculated as (total_marks / 300) * 100, assuming each subject is scored out of 100 marks.

* The super().save() call ensures the record is saved to the database after updating these fields.

## **Admin Registration**

In Django, the admin registration is a process that allows models to be managed through Django's built-in admin interface. This interface is a powerful feature provided by Django, making it easy to add, update, delete, and view records in the database without needing to build custom management pages. Admin registration connects Django models with this admin interface, enabling seamless backend management for database records.
```python
admin.site.register(Student1)
```

## **Serializers**
```python
class Student1serializers(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Student1
        fields = "__all__"
```

## **API Endpoints**

With the server up and running, you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Here, you’ll be able to manage student records by adding new entries, updating existing information, and viewing various performance metrics and statistics.
